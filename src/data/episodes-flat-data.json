The following morning, Jack Reacher arrives on a Greyhound bus and walks into town, where police arrest him at a diner for the murder. They send him to the local jail with Paul Hubble, a banker who has falsely confessed to the murder. Spivey, a crooked guard, puts them in with the general population, where Reacher brutally foils an attempt on their lives. Hubble explains he confessed to cover for a criminal organization that would have otherwise killed him and his family. After being released, KJ Kliner, the son of local businessman Kliner, verbally threatens Reacher in the town. When he later returns to the police station, he is informed about a second killing by local detective Oscar Finlay and cop Roscoe Conlink. At the morgue, a discussion about both the recent murder and another one earlier in the week leads him to identify the first victim as his older brother, Joe Reacher.",
