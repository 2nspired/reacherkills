## About
**reacherkills** is a fan-made site inspired by the Amazon Prime show Reacher.
[reacherkills.com](https://www.reacherkills.com/) tracks every confirmed kill by season and episode â€” including methods, weapons, and timecodes.

Built for fun and to sharpen my skills in UI/UX and responsive design, dynamic data handling, and frontend development.

The project will continue to grow as I add new kills from Seasons 2 and 3, along with an XP scoring system and dynamic filters.

| Body Counts and XP  |  Methods and Weapons  |
